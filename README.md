# traffic-light
this is a basic itertools program that i wanted to go above what was need for the project.

So i added turtle to it. I know i could have done it with pygame but I wanted to get more experance with turtle.

## TESTING
I am still learning about pytest and am not to sure how to test turtle so any advice would be great.
